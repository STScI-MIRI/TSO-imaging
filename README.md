# TSO-imaging
calculating the SNR of MIRI imaging as a function of extraction aperture &amp; filter using Pandeia. 

## Description
This repository contains a .json file and jupyter notebook which are used to calculate the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of MIRI imaging, as a function of extraction aperture size, for all MIRI imaging filters. The simulations were performed in response to an SCSB request to provide photometric extraction apertures for MIRI time series imaging.

## How-To
Executing the jupyter notebook requires installation of Pandeia and the Pandeia data package (see the STScI-SSB/pandeia and STScI-SSB/pandeia_data repositories). Installation of Pandeia should automatically install any dependencies.
